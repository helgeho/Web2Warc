### Web2Warc - your custom Web crawler

An easy-to-use and highly customizable crawler that enables you to create your own little Web archives (WARC/CDX).

#### Setup

To use Web2Warc you need to have [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) as well as [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org). Both are free and quickly installed.

As the next step clone and build this repository:

1. `git clone https://github.com/helgeho/Web2Warc.git`
2. `sbt assembly` (inside the project folder)

Now you should have a `web2warc-assembly-1.0.jar` file under `target/scala-2.10`. If that's the case, then you are all set and ready to run your first crawl.

#### Usage

We provide an example crawl specification under [`crawls/example.scala`](crawls/example.scala). In order to create your own one, simply copy this file and modify it according to your requirements.

To run a crawl specification (here `example.scala`) just run `scala -cp ../target/scala-2.10/web2warc-assembly-1.0.jar example.scala` inside the `crawls` folder, or use the provided `run.sh` script:

`./run.sh example.scala`

The resulting CDX and WARC files can be found under `crawls/out` or the path specified in the spec.

The example crawl specification with comments looks shown below. Any property that's not relevant for you can simply be omitted and default values will be applied.
(Developers, please have a look at `Web2Warc.strategy` and `Web2Warc.strategyDef` to implement your fully customized crawling behavior)

```scala
import de.l3s.web2warc.Web2Warc

Web2Warc.crawl.name = "Example" // the name of the crawl
Web2Warc.crawl.publisher = "Anonymous" // your name or company, just for the records, not sent to the server

Web2Warc.writer.path = "out" // the output path

Web2Warc.spec.maxLevel = 10 // follow at most 10 links
Web2Warc.spec.urlRegex = "[^:]+://([^/]*.|)example.com(/.*|$)" // crawl only within the domain example.com
Web2Warc.spec.preserveUrlRegex = ".*" // preserve all crawled URLs (default)
Web2Warc.spec.followRedirects = true // follow redirects (default)
Web2Warc.spec.increaseLevelOnRedirect = true // following redirects increases the level, just like following a link (default)

Web2Warc.seeds += "http://www.example.com" // where to start crawling (multiple seeds possible, just add more of these lines)

Web2Warc.run()
```

#### Analysis / Corpus Extraction

In order to analyze crawls created with Web2Warc or to build a corpus for your research from the resulting archive, please have a look at the [ArchiveSpark](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark) project.
